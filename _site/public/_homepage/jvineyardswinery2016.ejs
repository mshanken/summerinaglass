    <h6 class="card-title">J VINEYARDS & WINERY 2016 California Pinot Gris</h6>
    <p class="card-text">Long known as one of California’s top sparkling and varietal wine producers, J Vineyards & Winery’s Pinot Gris truly delights. Grown in Sonoma County, renowned for farm-to-table dining against the naturally stunning backdrop of sun-soaked hills, this wine is designed for laid back hospitality at its finest. On the nose are notes of candied pineapple, lemongrass, white peach, and jasmine. This wine is fruit forward with Anjou pear, yellow apple, and complex notes of orange blossom and a sliver of minerality on the palate. Serve it with anything from Manchego cheese and peach chutney to an all-time J favorite: seared scallops drizzled in a pineapple brown butter sauce.</p>
