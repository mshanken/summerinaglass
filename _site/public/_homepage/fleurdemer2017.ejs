    <p class="card-text">Grown in the rolling hills and valleys of Provence, where fields of lavender thrive in the warm sun and fresh, crisp seaside air, Fleur de Mer means “flower of the sea.” This brilliant, pale pink Rosé is beautifully balanced and round with ripe fruit notes — like red cherry, raspberry, white peach, and subtle hints of grapefruit — with tangy acidity and hints of lavender and Mediterranean herbs. This elegant Provençal Rosé is the perfect bottle to elevate your next barbecue or summer gathering with friends. Slip on a pair of oversized sunglasses and prepare to be transported to southern France — you deserve it.</p>
