    <h6 class="card-title">WILLIAM HILL ESTATE 2016 North Coast Sauvignon Blanc</h6>
    <p class="card-text">Selected from a variety of coastal vineyards, this wine embodies the very best of California living: pushing boundaries, discovering amazing new places, and living with intention. The highly fragrant North Coast Sauvignon Blanc offers aromas of citrus and honeysuckle. On the palate come zesty notes of Meyer lemon, lime leaf, ripe pear, and hints of peach. Balanced, smooth, round, and full of well developed citrus, stone fruit, and tropical notes, this wine is clean and refreshingly crisp on the finish. This is truly the ultimate California lifestyle wine.</p>
