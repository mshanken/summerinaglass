    <p class="card-text">It’s no wonder that this Sauvignon Blanc commands summer. Thanks to an exceptional vintage, the 2017 Whitehaven is superbly structured and balanced, capturing bright citrus notes of grapefruit and lemongrass, plus nuances of fresh-snipped grass and warm pear nectar with notes of tropical fruit. Crafted by a family winery, whose winemaker’s care and attention yields critically-acclaimed Sauvignon Blancs, this wine is vibrant, fruit forward, and boasts a long, clean finish. Enjoy it while gazing upon a starry night, mimicking the endless skies of New Zealand’s South Island.</p>
